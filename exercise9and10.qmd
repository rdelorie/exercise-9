```{r}
#data cleaning, code from lec 9 notes
aq_cleaned <- airquality %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  drop_na() #deletes missing values. skipped imputation
  vis_dat(aq_cleaned)
```

```{r}
model <- lm(Temp ~ Ozone * Solar.R, data = aq_cleaned)
summary(model)

# number 4 answer: Yes, based on the coefficients and information provided from this model I would say this seems like a valid model.

# number 5 answer: The modified r squared balue is 0.4963. This is adjusted for the number of predictors in my model. This means that my model explains 49.63% of the variation in the dependent variable.
